    "- After you have parsed your data, you need to store the data\n",
    "- Databases allows you to persist data or save the data\n",
    "- You can access the data later\n",
    "- SQL databases support transaction or they are transactional\n",
    "    - This means that the database is ACID\n",
    "    - ACID - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable\n",
    "    - series of operation that happen either all happen or nothing happens\n",
    "    - Example: Transfer money -- decrement one account and increment another account\n",
    "- We will use SQLite -- database saved as a file. Unlike flat files(csv files for example), the data stored in an optimized way so you can do queries. It is portable -- you can share your database file. Do not need to setup a database/server. It is a zero-configuration and serverless. No client/server interaction. An application will directly access the database file and read and write to it.\n",
    "    - Self-contained\n",
    "    - Serverless\n",
    "    - Zero-configuration\n",
    "    - Transactional -- all or nothing; either all instructions are executed successfully or nothing happens.\n",

    "- Database terminology\n",
    "    - A database contains tables\n",
