    "## Database\n",
    "- After you have parsed your data, you need to store the data\n",
    "- Databases allows you to persist data or save the data\n",
    "- You can access the data later\n",
    "- SQL databases support transaction or they are transactional\n",
    "    - This means that the database is ACID\n",
    "    - ACID - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable\n",
    "      - Atomicity - whole transaction or none\n",
    "      - Consistency - database moves from one valid state to another\n",
    "      - Isolation - transactions executed concurrently should have same effect as if executed sequentially\n",
    "      - Durable - committed transactions should be persistent and not affected by factors like power outage.\n",
    "    - series of operation that happen either all happen or nothing happens\n",
    "    - Example: Transfer money -- decrement one account and increment another account\n",
    "- We will use SQLite -- database saved as a file. Unlike flat files(csv files for example), the data stored in an optimized way so you can do queries. It is portable -- you can share your database file. Do not need to setup a database/server. It is a zero-configuration and serverless. No client/server interaction. An application will directly access the database file and read and write to it.\n",
    "    - Self-contained\n",

    "    - A database contains tables\n",

    "  - Command line interface (CLI):\n",
    "    - download from https://www.sqlite.org/\n",
    "  - Graphical user interface (GUI):\n",
    "    - Use DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)\n",

    "- Second Normal Form  (2NF):\n",
    "  1. the table is in first normal form\n",
    "  2. each non-key field is functionally dependent on the entire primary key\n",
